# Global Menu for GNOME

Global Menu for GNOME brings a clean, streamlined desktop layout to your system by adding a dedicated application menu directly into the GNOME top panel. Inspired by the sleek aesthetic of macOS, this extension places essential window actions, navigation controls, a System Menu, and quick-access options into a single unified top-bar component.

## 🚀 Installation

### Recommended: Install from GNOME Extensions

The easiest and safest way to install is directly from the official extensions website:

👉 [Get it on GNOME Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/10288/global-menu-for-gnome/)

Just click **Install**, no terminal required. Updates are delivered automatically through the Extensions app.

### Alternative: Install from Source (for developers/contributors)

If you want to run a development build or contribute, you can install from source instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShiroOSL/global-menu-for-gnome.git
cd global-menu-for-gnome
bash install.sh
```

🔄 **Apply changes:**
- On Wayland: log out of your desktop session and log back in.
- On X11: press `Alt + F2`, type `r`, and hit Enter to reload GNOME Shell.

Then enable **Global Menu for GNOME** using the Extensions app or Extension Manager.

## ❌ Uninstallation

```bash
cd global-menu-for-gnome
bash uninstall.sh
